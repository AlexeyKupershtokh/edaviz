## Is the idea to make edaviz open source at some point?

I (Florian) am afraid, there is no short answer to this because I struggled with this question myself for a long time. I hope you are fine with me sharing the full story with you:

When I started my Master Thesis, my primary goal was to make Data Science in Python faster. While writing the thesis, I always asked myself: "how can I create the biggest benefit for the community that already gave me so much?" In the beginning, my answer was to open-source the package after the Master Thesis.

However, in the course of the Master Thesis I observed 2 things:

1. the library might have a huge benefit
2. there is still so much more to do that would create an even bigger benefit for the Python community

Suddenly, I was not so sure any more if open-sourcing was the right call because as soon as I open-source it, there is no way for me to keep working on this full-time. However, I would love to keep working on this full-time in order to create even more benefits for the community in the future (In fact, I already have a spreadsheet with more than 17 big improvement points.).
I struggled really long with this back and forth and talked to many people who told me that open-sourcing might not always be the best. For now, I decided to create a startup with a friend of mine (Tobias) around edaviz so that we can provide - as we feel - an even bigger benefit to the community.

We are not sure yet what our business model will look like, but our basic notion is the following:

- If you do not earn money with the library, or are a student, or are researching for the public good, then you will receive free access.
- If the library helps you to earn money, then you should share a small portion of the money.

For the reasons above, the code is currently not open-source but we are looking for feedback and will give you free access to our alpha version.
If you want access to the alpha version and test it on your own projects (both commercial or noncommercial), please write me via the chat or join our waiting list. http://eepurl.com/go6Zlj

With much love,
Tobi and Florian

PS: We know that open-sourcing is a sensitive topic but our intentions are good and we try hard to provide value for the Python community :)
PPS: What do think about the struggle we have mentioned? Do you think it is the right approach? How would you go about this, if you were in our situation?
