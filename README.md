## The Problem

80% of the effort in Data Science projects is due to data understanding, transformation, and cleaning.
And of course, it all starts with data exploration. If you don't understand the data set, you cannot work with it.
Understanding data involves tedious work. You need to perform a lot of different analyses, handle the messy data and drill deeper, as there is always something odd in the data.

## The Solution

**edaviz** is a Python library which helps you to quickly understand and visualize your data frames. It is most helpful during data exploration after you received a new data set. However, you can also use it during data cleaning and data transformation, during feature engineering, or during model evaluation - whenever you need to understand your data.		
		
## The Features		

- Quick exploration without coding but full flexibility of code (after all, you are working in a Jupyter environment)	
- High interactivity and data drill down	
- Finds the best features for predicting your target	
- Explores predictive patterns between columns	
- Automatically chooses visualizations based on data types..
